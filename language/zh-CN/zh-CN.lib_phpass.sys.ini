LIB_PHPASS_XML_DESCRIPTION="PHPass 是一种便携的、用于 PHP 应用的密码哈希框架。The preferred (most secure) hashing method supported by phpass is the OpenBSD-style bcrypt (known in PHP as CRYPT_BLOWFISH), with a fallback to BSDI-style extended DES-based hashes (known in PHP as CRYPT_EXT_DES), and a last resort fallback to an MD5-based variable iteration count password hashing method implemented in phpass itself."
